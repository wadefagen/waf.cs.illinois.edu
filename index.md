# Hi, nice to have you here!

My name is Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider -- I am faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) at [The University of Illinois (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).  My passion is at the intersection of systems, data, and creating tools to nerd out with both systems and data through interactive data visualizations.  In my work, I work to educate, encourage, and insprire you to change the world.

## Teaching

I believe that education should be available and accessible.  To the further extent possible, my teaching at Illinois has been archived online and open for anyone to nerd out.  You can find links to my courses dating back to 2013:

<!--
- [Fall 2021: Introduction to Computer Systems (CS 240)](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs240/fa2021/)
- [Fall 2021: Data Science Discovery (CS 107 / STAT 107 / IS 107)](http://courses.las.illinois.edu/fall2021/stat107/)

## Visualization Systems

Most of my scholarly work is exploring engagement through data visualization systems and similar art, and much of this work is done in collaboration with undergraduate students and faculty from other domains.  If I have done a good job, you'll be able to spend hours nerding out with data in these visualizations:

- [91-DIVOC Project (Data-forward, interactive COVID-19 Visualizations)](https://91-divoc.com/)
- ["GPA Visualizations" of UIUC GPA Data](/discovery/gpa/)
- [All Visualizations...](/visualizations/)

<hr>

## Projects and Software

Beyond data visualizations, I work on open source tools and software to make life a bit nicer, easier, or more enjoyable.  A few recent tools:

- [Canvas External Grade Import Tool](/tools/Canvas-External-Grade-Import-Tool/) - New tool in Sept. 2021
- [Illinois LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/)
- More Tools: [Software Tools I've Built...](/tools/)
- More Projects: [d7: Data Science Research Collaborative...](http://d7.cs.illinois.edu/visualizations/)

<!-- - [All Projects and Software...](https://queue.illinois.edu/projects/) -->

## Impact

I have been able to share data and knowledge with many through the use of my tools, talks and workshops at conferences, and more.
