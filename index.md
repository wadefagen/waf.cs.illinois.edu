# Hi, nice to have you here!

My name is Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider -- I am faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) at [The University of Illinois (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).  My passion is at the intersection of systems, data, and creating tools to nerd out with both systems and data through interactive data visualizations.  In my work, I work to educate, encourage, and inspire you to change the world.

Since August 2021, I have worked to build the best data science resource online: [Data Science DISCOVERY](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/).  This free-to-consumer website is used daily as part of teaching of CS/STAT/IS 107, but also provides lectures, guides, and projects for anyone who wants to learn data science to use.

My greatest passion is visualizing data in a way that readers can nerd out with for hours.  If this interests you, you may be interested in my [visualizations of GPAs at The University of Illinois](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa/), my [data-forward, interactive visualizations of COVID-19 as part of my 91-DIVOC project](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/), or any of [my other visualizations](/visualizations/).

Finally, I've worked on several other projects that aim to highlight Illini or make our Illinois courses world-class courses.  These projects include the [Illini LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/),  [Queue@Illinois](https://queue.illinois.edu/), and [others](/tools/).

## The Latest!

{% card August 15, 2022 &mdash; New Visualization: Temperature Waves %}
We've created our final weather-related visualization this summer, [**Temperature Waves**: A historical snapshot of the current day's high temperatures](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/Daily-Weather-Waves-of-Daily-High-Temperatures/).  This was created in in collaboration with Katy Miles, Angie Cheng, and Karle Flanagan!

This visualization will always show you context around today's temperature for 5,000 locations around the United States!  For example, today on August 15, all of the data will be historical high temperatures for every August 14th-16th for the selected location.

With some extra time, we extended this work to low temperatures as well in [**Daily Weather Waves of Daily Low Temperatures
](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/Daily-Weather-Waves-of-Daily-Low-Temperatures/).
{% endcard %}


{% card May 13, 2022 &mdash; Infinite Maze %}
In CS 240 this semester, we created an infinitely large maze with contributions from every student in the course.  You can [now explore the infinite maze yourself](/pages/cs340/infinite-maze/) and see what the amazing students in CS 240 created this semester!
{% endcard %}

{% card April 20, 2022 &mdash; New Visualization: Temperature Radials %}
[**Temperature Radials**: A data-forward radial visualization of the historical temperature record of every large city in America](https://vis.cs.illinois.edu/weather/temperature-radial/), created in collaboration with Katy Miles, Angie Cheng, and Karle Flanagan!
{% endcard %}

{% card April 13, 2022 &mdash; GPA Dataset and Visualization Updated %}
The three GPA data visualizations are updated for Fall 2022 registration, including UIUC GPAs from Summer 2021, Fall 2021, and Winter 2021/22!

- [Grade disparity between sections at UIUC](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/)
- [Every Gen Ed at UIUC, by GPA](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/every_gen_ed_at_uiuc_by_gpa/)
- [GPAs of Every Course at The University of Illinois](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/)

In addition, the raw data is available for everyone to use, explore, and nerd out with as part of my [datasets repo on GitHub](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets). ðŸŽ‰
{% endcard %}

{% card March 20, 2022 &mdash; New Visualization: Historic Snowfall and Snow Depth %}

New Visualization: [**Historic Snowfall and Snow Depth**: A data-forward exploration of historic snowfall and snow depth across 5,000 cities in the United States](https://vis.cs.illinois.edu/weather/historic-snowfall-and-snow-depth/)!  This work is the first data-forward exploration of the snowfall and snow depth record of every major US city and was a collaboration with Angie Cheng, Katy Miles, Karle Flanagan, and Emily Crawford!

## Teaching

I believe that education should be available and accessible.  To the further extent possible, my teaching at Illinois has been archived online and open for anyone to nerd out.  You can find links to my courses dating back to 2013:

- [**Spring 2022**: Introduction to Computer Systems (CS 240)](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs240/sp2022/)
- [**Spring 2022**: Data Science Discovery (CS 107 / STAT 107 / IS 107)](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/stat107-sp22/)
- [Coursera MOOC: Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals)
- [Previous Courses, Teaching Philosophy, and More on Teaching...](/teaching/)

<hr>

## Visualization Systems

Most of my scholarly work is exploring engagement through data visualization systems and similar art, and much of this work is done in collaboration with undergraduate students and faculty from other domains.  If I have done a good job, you'll be able to spend hours nerding out with data in these visualizations:

- [Historic Snowfall and Snow Depth](https://vis.cs.illinois.edu/weather/historic-snowfall-and-snow-depth/)
- [91-DIVOC Project (Data-forward, interactive COVID-19 Visualizations)](https://91-divoc.com/)
- ["GPA Visualizations" of UIUC GPA Data](/discovery/gpa/)
- [All Visualizations...](/visualizations/)

<hr>

## Projects and Software

Beyond data visualizations, I work on open source tools and software to make life a bit nicer, easier, or more enjoyable.  A few recent tools:

- [Canvas External Grade Import Tool](/tools/Canvas-External-Grade-Import-Tool/) - New tool in Sept. 2021
- [Illinois LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/)
- More Tools: [Software Tools I've Built...](/tools/)
- More Projects: [d7: Data Science Research Collaborative...](http://d7.cs.illinois.edu/visualizations/)

<!-- - [All Projects and Software...](https://queue.illinois.edu/projects/) -->

## Impact

I have been able to share data and knowledge with many through the use of my tools, talks and workshops at conferences, and more.
