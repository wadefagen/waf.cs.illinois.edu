# Hi, nice to have you here!

My name is **Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider** -- I am faculty in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) in the [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).  My passion is at the intersection of systems, data, and creating tools to nerd out with both systems and data -- particularly through interactive tools and data visualizations.  In my work, I work to educate, encourage, and inspire you to change the world.

I hope you'll stay and nerd out!  Here's a few places to get started:

- **Visualizations**: [Visualizations of GPAs at the University of Illinois](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa/) and [my other visualizations](/visualizations/).
- **Being an Illini ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™**: [Illini LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/), [Queue@Illinois](https://queue.illinois.edu/), and [other tools](/tools/).
- **Teaching**: [Data Science DISCOVERY + CS/STAT/IS 107](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/), my [Cousera MOOC: "Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1), and the associated [Cousera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals).
- **Me**: [CV / Bio](/about/), [Impact of my Work](/impact/), and [Invited Talks](/talks/).

<!--
In the past decade, I have had the honor to teach over 200,000 students between my open-access [courses at Illinois](/teaching/) and my [MOOCs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1)/[specalization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals) on Coursera. In 2023, my [DISCOVERY platform](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/) work with [Prof. Karle Flanagan](https://kflan.stat.illinois.edu/) was [selected as one of the campus investments for growth](https://provost.illinois.edu/about/initiatives/investment-for-growth-program/fy24-funded-programs/) to establish Illinois as a national leader in data science education.

When I'm not teaching, my passion is visualizing data in a way that readers can nerd out with for hours.  You can find my work in [visualizations of GPAs at the University of Illinois](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa/), my [data-forward, interactive visualizations of COVID-19 as part of my 91-DIVOC project](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/), or any of [my other visualizations](/visualizations/).

Finally, I love being an ILL-INI ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™ and I am always working on a project to highlight Illini and make our Illinois courses more visible.  Recent projects have included the [Illini LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/), [Queue@Illinois](https://queue.illinois.edu/), and [others](/tools/).

{% card "January 21, 2025 &mdash; New Visualizations: Trends in High School GPAs" %}

As part of University of Illinois' "Love Data Week" celebrations, I put together a visualization to answer a question I have had for several years: *"What is the trend of high school GPAs among admitted freshman, and has COVID-19 changed that trend?"*

Nerd out with me exploring the data about the high school GPAs of the incoming freshman classes across Big Ten Universities:

## Teaching

I believe that education should be available and accessible.  To the further extent possible, my teaching at Illinois has been archived online and open for anyone to nerd out.  You can find links to my courses dating back to 2013:

- [**Spring 2025**: Data Science Discovery (CS 107 / STAT 107 / IS 107)](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)
- Previously at Illinois: [CS 340: Intro Systems](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs340/sp2023/) (fa20-sp23), [CS 423: Operating Systems](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs423/sp2021/syllabus/) (sp21), [CS 225: Data Structures](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2019/info/syllabus/) (fa17-sp19), [CS 105: Intro CS](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs105/sp2015/syllabus.php) (sp14-fa16), and [CS 241: Systems Programming](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs241/fa2013/syllabus.html) (fa08-fa13)
- On Coursera: [Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1), [Ordered Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-2), [Unordered Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-3), and [Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals), 
- [Previous Courses, Teaching Philosophy, and More on Teaching...](/teaching/)

## Visualization Systems

Most of my scholarly work is exploring engagement through data visualization systems and similar art, and much of this work is done in collaboration with undergraduate students and faculty from other domains.  If I have done a good job, you'll be able to spend hours nerding out with data in these visualizations:

- [Historic Snowfall and Snow Depth](https://vis.cs.illinois.edu/weather/historic-snowfall-and-snow-depth/)
- [91-DIVOC Project (Data-forward, interactive COVID-19 Visualizations)](https://91-divoc.com/)
- ["GPA Visualizations" of UIUC GPA Data](/discovery/gpa/)
- [All Visualizations...](/visualizations/)

<hr>

## Projects and Software

Beyond data visualizations, I work on open source tools and software to make life a bit nicer, easier, or more enjoyable.  A few recent tools:

- [Canvas External Grade Import Tool](/tools/Canvas-External-Grade-Import-Tool/)
- [Illinois LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/generate/)
- More Tools: [Software Tools I've Built...](/tools/)
- More Projects: [d7: Data Science Research Collaborative...](http://d7.cs.illinois.edu/visualizations/)

<!-- - [All Projects and Software...](https://queue.illinois.edu/projects/) -->

<hr>

## Impact

I have been able to share data and knowledge with many through the use of my tools, talks and workshops at conferences, and more.

- [Adoptions, Mentions, and Impact](/impact/)
- [My CV and More About Me...](/about/)
