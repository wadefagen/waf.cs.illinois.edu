# Hi, nice to have you here!

My name is **Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider** -- I am faculty in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) in the [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/).  My passion is at the intersection of systems, data, and creating tools to nerd out with both systems and data -- particularly through interactive tools and data visualizations.  In my work, I work to educate, encourage, and inspire you to change the world.

I believe that education should be available and accessible.  To the further extent possible, my teaching at Illinois has been archived online and open for anyone to nerd out.  You can find links to my courses dating back to 2013:
