# Writing you a Letter of Recommendation

Letters of recommendations are often the most important part of your graduate application, particularly for research-based graduate work.  A letter serves as a professional introduction to another, allowing me to share about the passion you have for your work, the caliber of your work, your work ethic, and the responsibilities you have had as part of your work with me. 

It is an honor to write a letter of recommendation and I will be thrilled to write one for you if we have worked together.  If you have completed a thesis, independent study, worked for a significant period of time any group I lead, or worked with me as part of course staff, continue reading about "Full Letters" below.

If the only way I know you is through your enrollment in one of my large-lecture courses I, unfortunately, have no good basis for knowing enough about you to write a strong letter.  Additionally, I receive sometimes hundreds of these requests a year.  The only thing I would be able to say is something to the effect that "you were in my course in \[TERM\] and earned an A+" and, usually, this sort of a letter is seen as a negative since it fails to address your work ethic, responsibilities, or other elements usually found in a strong letter.  For these "Coursework Letters", I will only write them if you are applying to **ONLY** coursework-based masters programs.


## Coursework Letters

I will write you a coursework letter if:

1. You have earned an **A** or **A+** in any course I taught with you as a student,
2. You have **NOT**:
    - worked on a thesis under my supervision,
    - taken an independent study under my supervision,
    - worked as part of any group I lead, or
    - worked with me as part of course staff,
3. You are applying to **ONLY** coursework-based programs,
4. There is **at least two full weeks** before the deadline of the letter,
5. Your CV/resume is complete and ready to send to me immediately, AND
6. You have reviewed and understand the information above (in the introduction) about this being a weak letter

If you would like me to write this letter, please do the following:

1. Complete the [Request for a Coursework Letter of Recommendation from Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1658631267) form that I created,
2. Send an e-mail to me with your CV/resume **AND** statement of purpose (so that I can understand why you're applying),
3. I will confirm that I will write you a letter as soon as I can review both of the above items, usually within 24 hours.  You should not assume I will write one until you receive my confirmation.


## Full Letters

If we have worked together in a meaningful way as outlined above, be sure that:

- There is **at least** two full weeks before the deadline of the letter,
- Your CV/resume is complete and ready to send to me immediately, and
- You are willing to "waive the right to view the recommendation" so that I can speak candidly about your work

If these are all true, please write to me about what programs you're looking to apply to and I'll follow up to make sure I can craft the better letter possible for you!
