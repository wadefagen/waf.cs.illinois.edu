# Joining CS 340 as a CA!

Thanks for your interest in joining the CS 340 team!  

**Who**: I am looking for UIUC students who are reliable, professional, and love teaching just as much as I do. :)  

**When**:  Please submit this form as soon as possible, as applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. I'll contact you before the start of the semester with a decision.

**What**: CAs are an integral part of the course community and we're just building a new course -- so there's a lot of exciting work to be done and a lot of impact to be had! :)  Tasks include:

1. Assisting students in open lab/office hours with MPs,
2. Developing new content for the course website/guidebook,
3. Assisting in the deployment, design, and grading of MPs,
4. Creating new content for PrairieLearn-based problems, and
5. Creating and/or maintaining other course resources

**Why**: CS 340 is a new Computer Science course that covers material from CS 233, CS 241, and beyond (with a focus on cloud computing, networking, and cloud-based services/APIs/architectures). As part of this role, you will meet with the full course staff in a weekly staff meeting. I believe that a CA role should have personal and professional growth and I actively give more responsibility and visibility to outstanding, returning CAs.  If you enjoy teaching, systems, cloud programming, and being part of an amazing team, it's a really sweet gig!

In recent semesters, the hiring process has been very competitive. We will have a very limited number of positions available at all levels of experience. In general, successful applicants are:

- Students who have taken CS 240/340 and received an A or an A+ (strong preferred),  OR
- Exceptional students who have taken BOTH CS 233 and CS 241/341 and received an A or an A+ in BOTH courses

This is a PAID position based on the [CS salary scale found here](https://course-assistants.cs.illinois.edu/rates).  You must submit two forms to complete an application:

- The [CS 340 CA Application](https://forms.gle/vB21Ls77259Hsnsa7)
- The [Department of Computer Science Application](https://opportunities.cs.illinois.edu/)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (waf@illinois.edu).
