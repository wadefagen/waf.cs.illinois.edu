### Invited Talks, Panels, and Workshops

I love sharing my passion of Computer Science and inspiring others to build amazing things.  A few recent talks I have had the privilege to give:

<ul>
  <li>
    Engagement Across Modalities in Large Lecture Courses, Panelist, June 2021
    <div class="pub-etc">
      <blockquote class="ml-0 mb-0">
      This panel focuses on sharing six strategies that improve students’ academic engagement, progress, and success no matter how they engage with our courses: online asynchronous, online synchronous, or in-person.  After this session you’ll have several ideas on quick additions to your syllabus to increase engagement with your students.

    Data Science and Visualization Workshop at HackIllinois, Aprli 2021 [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1dWSjrpHDc">YouTube</a>]
    <div class="pub-etc">
      <blockquote class="ml-0 mb-0">In this recorded workshop from HackIllinois 2021, join UIUC CS Professor Wade as he explores the power of data visualization and its importance in enabling you to showcase your fantastic work. Get ready to learn how to perform data analysis in Python -- using classical algorithms and simple, understandable techniques -- and transform the result of the analysis into an interactive data visualization using d3.js. By the end of the workshop, you will be have all the tools you need to nerd out with your own data visualization running right on your own machine while learn a lot of tips along the way!</blockquote>
