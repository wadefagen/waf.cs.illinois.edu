#### Teaching Philosophy

I believe that world-class education is education that is worth sharing. If you are going through your life sharing the meals you eat, the sunset in the evening, and other ordinary things, your educational experience should be *at least* among those experiences (and, hopefully, exceptionally better).

Toward that end, classes I teach contain major components that are a sharable experience. More on this soon. :)


#### Independent Study / Senior Thesis / Senior Project

I have had the privilege of working with over 100 students in advising an independent study, senior project, or senior thesis.   When I advise an independent study of any form, I am making a commitment to you to work with you as we explore something new and interesting.  Similarly, I expect you to be fully committed to the project.

If you have been a student in one or more of my courses, have completed CS 225, and are willing to dedicate significant time to work on new and hard problems, let's chat about it!
